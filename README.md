This repository is for the development of a Bluetooth beacon to work with iOS iBeacon and similar Android routines.

The goal is to document the progress in the wiki area, including tech findings and development issues and to provide code / SD image / iOS code for interfacing and Android code for interfacing.  This should be a good opportunity to explore what can be done with the tech, including near field positioning.
